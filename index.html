        <div class="project">
            <h3>Project Title: Building My Professional Portfolio Website</h3>
            <p><strong>Overview:</strong> I’m embarking on a project to create a personal portfolio website using Stephen R. Covey’s “The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People” as a guide. This website will be my digital showcase, highlighting my achievements, skills, and potential for future career opportunities or educational advancements. By applying Covey’s habits, I’ll not only build a portfolio but also enhance my personal effectiveness and professionalism.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Design and develop my personal portfolio website.</li>
                <li>Apply the 7 Habits of Highly Effective People to my personal and professional growth.</li>
                <li>Present my skills, projects, and achievements in a clear and professional manner.</li>
                <li>Reflect on what I’ve learned and how I’ve applied Covey’s habits.</li>

            <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> After some research, I’ve decided to use WordPress for my portfolio website. WordPress strikes a good balance between user-friendliness and customization options, making it perfect for creating a professional site without requiring deep coding knowledge. Choosing WordPress is a proactive step because it allows me to build a robust and attractive website.</p>
