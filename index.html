        <h2>My Projects</h2>
        <div class="project">
            <h3>Project Title: Building My Professional Portfolio Website</h3>
            <p><strong>Overview:</strong></p>
            <p>I’m embarking on a project to create a personal portfolio website using Stephen R. Covey’s “The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People” as a guide. This website will be my digital showcase, highlighting my achievements, skills, and potential for future career opportunities or educational advancements.</p>
            <p>By applying Covey’s habits, I’ll not only build a portfolio but also enhance my personal effectiveness and professionalism.</p>
            <p><strong>Objectives:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Design and develop my personal portfolio website.</li>
                <li>Apply the 7 Habits of Highly Effective People to my personal and professional growth.</li>
                <li>Present my skills, projects, and achievements in a clear and professional manner.</li>
                <li>Reflect on what I’ve learned and how I’ve applied Covey’s habits.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Assignment Breakdown:</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Habit 1: Be Proactive</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Task 1: Research and Select a Web Development Platform or Tool</strong></p>
            <p>Rationale:</p>
            <p>After some research, I’ve decided to use WordPress for my portfolio website. WordPress strikes a good balance between user-friendliness and customization options, making it perfect for creating a professional site without requiring deep coding knowledge.</p>
            <p>Choosing WordPress is a proactive step because it allows me to build a robust and attractive website. I’ve signed up for an online course to learn the ins and outs of WordPress, including how to use plugins and themes to enhance my site. By taking this initiative, I’m ensuring I have the skills needed to make the most out of WordPress, which will help me create a strong portfolio that effectively showcases my abilities and achievements.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Habit 2: Begin with the End in Mind</strong></p>
